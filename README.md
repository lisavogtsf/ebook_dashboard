#eBook Dashboard

The first of three projects for the Web Development Immersive at General Assembly.

###Overview
The eBook Dashboard compares ebook information from a pre-loaded Postgres database with ebook information from the iTunes Store, including price information from multiple countries.

###Motivation
The eBook Dashboard is a product designed for small ebook publishers who sell from their own websites as well as through third-party websites like the Apple iTunes Store, Amazon's Kindle Direct Publishing, Barnes and Noble's NOOK store, Scribd and Kobo. By making side-by-side comparisons between website listings, the eBook Dashboard allows small publishers to verify that their ebooks are being sold with the correct metadata, including cover art, price and descriptive text. 

The preloaded titles are from the small ebook publisher [Belgrave House/Regency Reads](http://www.belgravehouse.com/ "Belgrave House/Regency Reads")
